description: Guidelines for setup guidelines and feature development with a strong emphasis on TDD, incremental progress, and environment-aware testing.
globs:
  - "**/*.py"
  - "/app/**"
---

## Summary:
Enforce a strict test-driven development workflow with continuous integration and deployment for a production-ready FastAPI project. Each feature goes through a complete TDD lifecycle with automated testing across all environments, deployed to Heroku Eco dynos with LTS dependencies.
## Goals:
- **Prioritize TDD**: Write tests before implementation
- **Automate Everything**: Tests, linting, formatting, deployment
- **Continuous Verification**: Test in every environment automatically
- **Incremental Progress**: Small, tested, working features deployed frequently
- **Sustainable Infrastructure**: Use Eco dynos on Heroku
- **Stability**: Use LTS/stable versions of Python and dependencies
---
## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD) Workflow
### The TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor):
1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
   - Create test file in `app/tests/`
   - Define expected behavior clearly
   - Run test to confirm it fails (for the right reason)

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
   - Implement just enough to make the test pass
   - Focus on functionality, not perfection
   - Run test to confirm it passes

3. **REFACTOR**: Improve the implementation
   - Clean up the code while keeping tests green
   - Apply code quality tools
   - Ensure tests still pass after refactoring

### TDD Requirements:
- **No code without tests**: Every function must have corresponding tests
- **Test coverage targets**: Aim for >90% code coverage
- **Test isolation**: Tests should not depend on each other
- **Fast test suite**: Optimize for quick feedback cycles
---
## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline Integration
### Feature Development Flow:
```
Local Development → GitHub CI → Review App → Production (Eco Dyno)
     (TDD Cycle)     (Tests)    (Testing)   (Verification)
```

### CI/CD Core Requirements:
- **Fail Fast**: Any test or lint failure blocks deployment
- **Automated**: Migrations, tests, deployment all automatic
- **Consistent**: Tests must pass in all environments
- **Verifiable**: Run health checks after deployment
- **Eco-friendly**: Deploy to Heroku Eco dynos
---
## 🐍 Python Version & Dependencies
- Use **LTS Python version** (currently Python 3.10 LTS)
- Pin all dependency versions for stability
- Prefer packages with long-term support
- Update dependencies on a scheduled basis, not ad-hoc
- Specify Python version in `.python-version`:
  ```
  3.10
  ```
- Use dependency version constraints that specify minimum compatible versions
---
## 🔧 Python Best Practices
- Follow **PEP 8** and use **type hints** throughout.
- Favor **Pythonic idioms** and meaningful naming.
- Keep functions focused and modular.
- Raise helpful exceptions and log where useful.
---
## 🧹 Code Quality Tools
### Formatting
- Use **Black** for automatic code formatting with default settings
- Use **isort** to organize imports with Black-compatible settings
- Add pre-commit hooks to format code automatically before commits

### Linting
- Use **Flake8** with appropriate plugins:
  - `flake8-bugbear` for additional bug detection
  - `flake8-docstrings` for docstring style checking
  - `flake8-comprehensions` for better list/dict comprehensions
- Configure with reasonable line length (88 to match Black)
- Run linting in CI pipeline to block non-compliant code

### Type Checking
- Use **Mypy** for static type analysis
- Enable strict mode for maximum type safety
- Run type checking in the CI pipeline
- Add inline type ignores only when absolutely necessary
---
## 🚀 FastAPI & Project Structure
- Use **Pydantic** for data validation and response models.
- Leverage **FastAPI dependency injection** where helpful.
- Organize with **APIRouter**, one per domain.
- Structure the project like this:
```
app/
├── main.py
├── api/          # Routers
├── models/       # ORM models
├── schemas/      # Pydantic schemas
├── services/     # Business logic
├── db/           # DB config
├── core/         # Settings, middleware, config
├── tests/        # Pytest tests for TDD
│   ├── conftest.py
│   ├── test_unit/  # Unit tests
│   └── test_integration/ # Integration tests
├── .env          # Local environment
├── requirements.txt
├── .python-version  # Specify Python version
├── .github/workflows/ # CI/CD pipelines
└── openapi.json  # API specification
```
---
## 📄 OpenAPI Specification
- Maintain an up-to-date OpenAPI specification
- Export the spec using FastAPI's built-in tools
- Update the spec after each feature addition
- Use the spec for documentation and client generation
---
## 📊 Test Coverage and Reporting
- Use `pytest-cov` to measure test coverage
- Set minimum coverage thresholds in CI pipeline
- Generate coverage reports after test runs
- Example: `pytest --cov=app --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term`
---
## 🔄 Feature Development Workflow
For each feature:
1. **Create a feature branch** from main
2. **Write tests first** (RED phase)
3. **Implement the feature** (GREEN phase)
4. **Clean and optimize** (REFACTOR phase)
5. **Submit pull request** - CI runs all checks
6. **Automatic deployment** to review app
7. **Verify production** after merge to main
---
## 🧪 Environment-Aware Testing
All tests must work in both local (SQLite) and production (PostgreSQL) environments:
- Use a `Settings` class with environment detection.
- Use a `DATABASE_URL` env variable override pattern.
- For local testing, default to `sqlite:///./dev.db`.
- In CI or Heroku, use the `DATABASE_URL` Heroku provides.
- When running and testing local use venv and python3 (I always run on a mac)
---
## 🚀 GitHub & Heroku CI/CD Pipeline
### GitHub Actions Workflow:
```yaml
name: TDD CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:

## 🗃️ Database Migrations
- Use Alembic for all schema changes
- Create migration scripts for every model change
- Test migrations in both directions (up/down)
---
## 🔒 Security Practices
- Never hardcode secrets; use environment variables
- Implement proper authentication with JWT or OAuth2
- Use HTTPS in production
- Apply input validation on all endpoints
---
## ⚙️ Environment-Based Settings
- Store configuration in a `Settings` class using `pydantic.BaseSettings`
- Read from `.env` locally and from Heroku env vars in production
- Detect and switch database URIs automatically
---
## ⚠️ Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes for domain-specific errors
- Implement global exception handlers
- Return consistent error responses with appropriate status codes
---
## 📚 API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with clear descriptions
- Provide examples for request/response bodies
- Use FastAPI's automatic docs with enhanced descriptions
---
## ⚡ Performance Considerations
- Use async where appropriate (I/O operations)
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Paginate list endpoints
- Use database indices for frequently queried fields
- Optimize for eco dyno constraints:
  - Efficient memory usage
  - Resource-conscious background tasks
  - Appropriate connection pooling
---
## 🧠 Apply this rule when:
- Writing or editing any function, route, schema, or service
- Adding a new domain to the API
- Creating tests for new or existing functionality
- Setting up CI/CD pipelines
- Starting a new feature branch
- Submitting or reviewing pull requests
